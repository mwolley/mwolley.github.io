        <p> Hello! I am a second semester senior at Unviersity of Massachusetts Amherst. I am majoring in English, specializing in creative writing, and minoring in education. I am currently looking for an editorial position in the Greater Boston Area beginning in mid-May.</p>
        <p> I grew up in Melrose, Massachusetts, where I still permanently reside. I work part time as a server at Turner's Seafood in Melrose. I have been tutoring since senior year in high school, and have worked with students ranging from second grade through college. I also worked as an Educator at the USS Constitution Museum during summer of 2018.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my dog, drawing, writing, and listening to music.
        </p>
