        <p>I am a second semester senior at University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in English with a Creative Writing Specialization and Education Minor.  I first began writing creatively in 2011, when I was a freshman in high school. I enjoy writing and reading short fiction, science fiction, and horror.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Melrose, Massachusetts, where I still reside. I spent my freshman year at Westfield State University, before transferring to UMASS Amherst. I am majoring in English because writing has always been a passion of mine. I have also been a private tutor since 2016. During the summer of 2018, I worked as a museum educator at the USS Constitution Museum in Charlestown, Massachusetts. I have also worked as a server since 2014 at Turner's Seafood in Melrose, Massachusetts. Curently, I am seeking an entry-level editorial job in the Greater Boston area post-graduation in May of 2019.  </p>
