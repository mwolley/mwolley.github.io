    <h2>Prototype Brainstorm Ideas</h2>

    <h4>Post and Bean Cafe</h4>
Post and Bean is the cafe located in the Design Building at UMASS Amherst. I currently work there, and there are no websites for specific dining locations on campus. All dining information is located on a clustered app called UMASS dining. On this website, I would include Post and Bean's daily hours, the menu, and nutrition facts. The target audience would be UMASS students and faculty.

    <h4>College Survival</h4>
This site would include study tips for UMASS students, as well as the best places to study, places with student discounts, daily college advice, etc. The target adudience would be UMASS Amherst Undergraduate students, but most of the content could be helpful for all students.
